# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQLite-and-Python

For this project, we will be looking at the CIA World Factbook which is a compendium of statistics based on Earth's countries.

We are using the sqlite3 module alongside pandas to run SQL queries and be able to display them as DataFrame objects. 

By the end, we aim to generate plots to gain a better understanding of the data that we have collected and test our knowledge a bit by finding the country with the highest population density.
